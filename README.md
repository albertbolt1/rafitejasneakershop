# Payment Request API Sample App

A mini-app that presents a basic shopping experience where a user can buy emoji. This app shows how to use the
[Payment Request APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.payments) to implement the checkout experience. It also demonstrates a basic multi-page XAML UI that uses
the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.

This sample runs on the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
